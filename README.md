As the title says, this is another Youtube downloader for a Windows desktop done just for the sake of practicing with C# and grasping the very basics of WPF.

Made with:
- C# 
- .NET Framework 4.7
- [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/getting-started/introduction-to-wpf-in-vs)

Nuget dependencies:
